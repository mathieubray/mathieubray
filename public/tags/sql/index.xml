      <description>Code for this analysis is availabile on Github
Thought I would offer up a quick post on something that had sidetracked me earlier this week, namely how to extract notes and annotations in Mendeley using R. Basically I was having a similar problem as Daniel Hynk here, which he solved using Python. I too use Mendeley as a reference manager, which also has the handy feature of allowing users to add their own annotations and notes to their saved documents.</description>
