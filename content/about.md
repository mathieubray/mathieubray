Hi! My name is Mathieu Bray and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan School of Public Health](https://www.sph.umich.edu/). I achieved candidacy in May of 2015, and am currently working on my dissertation under the supervision of [Dr. Peter X-K Song](http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/). I previously obtained my B.Sc. (Joint Honours in Statistics and Computer Science) in 2012 from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca).

My main research focus has been in the application of probabilistic and statistical techniques to the paired kidney exchange problem, otherwise known as Kidney Paired Donation (KPD). To that end, I have been assisting the [KPD Simulation Group](http://kecc.sph.umich.edu/projects/optimization-and-simulation-kidney-paired-donation-program) at the [U-M Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center](http://kecc.sph.umich.edu/) with investigations into optimization strategies for KPD, as well as development of software for optimization and management of KPD networks.

This space will occasionally feature some short [blog posts](https://www.mathieubray.com/post/) on small side projects, mostly using hockey statistics. Feel free to read those, then check out my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mathieubray), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieubray) and [GitHub](http://github.com/mathieubray) pages.
